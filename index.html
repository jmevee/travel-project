            <h3>Los Angeles, the city of Angeles</h3>
            <p>
              Los Angeles often referred to by its initials L.A., officially the
              City of Los Angeles, is the most populous city in the U.S. state
              of California. With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city
              limits as of 2020, Los Angeles is the second-most populous city in
              the United States, behind only New York City; it is the
              commercial, financial and cultural center of the Southern
              California region. Los Angeles has a Mediterranean climate, an
              ethnically and culturally diverse population, in addition to a
              sprawling metropolitan area.
            </p>

              Los Angeles is a sprawling Southern California city and the center
